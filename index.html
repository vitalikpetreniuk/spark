        		<p>I bring more than 20 years of extensive cross-industry experience in digital learning and transformation strategy, research and consultancy, and a background in creative e-learning and film production to my UX research and design practice. I specialise in human-centred technology-enhanced learning experiences and technologies. My methods and approach draw deeply on the Learning Sciences including Social and Cognitive Psychology, Ethnography and behavioural linguistics. My applied methodology to UX research and design is based around the CAP design principles originally created to support good practice blended learning experience: Connect &amp; Engage, Actionable &amp; Sustainable, Personal &amp; Meaningful.</p>

					<p>Based on extensive research, practice and piloting, I developed the CAP Principles of digital learning design and evaluation specifically to help practitioners develop good practice in blended learning. The problem with BL is that it's never been properly defined. The CAP Principles are an attempt to address this gap and provide a practical methodology.</p>
					<p>The CAP Principles are also a really useful framework for designing discovery and usability research programmes, and for benchmarking their findings. Consistent with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">W3C Accessibility Guidelines</a>&nbsp;and with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GDS</a>.</p>

        		<p>In the last 4 years, I've led research projects investigating the apprentice user experience (transition to FT employment, and impact of C-19/lockdown); designed new content for a leading adult skills assessment platform, researched how adult ESOL learners and practitioners currently use EdTech and their challenges, and developed and piloted an innovative custom-designed adult pedagogy for a particular category of learner as a part of a transnational project team. As well as leading to design improvement, my work has led to change in government policy at the system level with improvements to learners' experience. I've written and published around 30 books, research papers and blog articles, and webinars. And I'm always ready to learn more!</p>
